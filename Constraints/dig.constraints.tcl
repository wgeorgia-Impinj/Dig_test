###TIM CLOCKS####
# Discussion with Theron and Charles 01/29/2018
# (1) The uncalibrated OSC freq max is 1920kHz, period 520.83 ns. --> rounded down to 520ns
# (2) The calibrated OSC freq max is 1280kHz + 8% uncertainty (1382khz) 
# Just to make this more difficult, we also have a feature called osc_boost,
# which changes the osc frequency during backscatter to hit certain 
# data rates. The max osc boost value is 1416khz.
# So, 1.08*1416=1529khz would technically be be our max calibrated frequency
# Period = 654ns --> rounded off to 650ns
# (3) Discussion with Jas and Jesse (06/01/18)
# Jas to reran Oscillator simulations to find our what the real max frequency is.
# Untrimmed max frequencies that we will see in the oscillator:
# TT = 1.55MHz
# FF = 1.9MHz
# SF = 1.55MHz
# FS = 1.65MHz
# SS = 1.3MHz

# To further complicate this discussion, the Production Test team runs vectors fast to
# decrease test time. Therefore, when communicating through the DTI (esp. when
# DTI_CLK_SEL=1), PTE supplies a 1280kHz+20% = 1536kHz clock (see MAUI-533). This clock
# is not boosted; boosting only applies to the internal oscillator. Therefore, the max
# "calibrated" clock is actually 1536kHz plus margin, though not as bad as the 1800kHz
# being used below.

    # Leaving the above as its what LX1 was closed at. Might not have been pessimistic enough. Should have closed at 1900khz which is max uncallibrated osc freq.
